 <description>The Kestrel Starliner might look like a Kestrel, but a large amount of the hull has been repurposed for luxury travel and accommodation. Due to the complexities of installing the necessary amenities, weapon bays have had to been reduced in size along with other restrictions resulting in fewer customization possibilities. To make up for the loss of utility, the Starliner edition has some very carefully engineered hull modifications that increase the overall manoeuverability along with a self-repair system capable of slowly regenerating damaged armour. Furthermore, the luxury amenities are powered by a backup energy supply that charges when the ship's energy reserves are full. Routing life support systems and other non-combat systems via the auxiliary power systems primarily, the ship is able to manage its energy much more effectively. Although some would say that the Gawain is just as good for luxury travel, there are others claiming that such talk is pure jealousy.</description>
